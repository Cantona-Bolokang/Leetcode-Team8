Problem 4: Add Two Numbers

Problem Statement:  
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.  
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.  
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.  
The two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Algorithm Explanation:  

1. Initialize Variables:
   - `carry` is set to 0 and will hold any overflow because when digits add up to more than 9, we need to carry over the extra to the next digit.
   - `first` and `second` are pointers to traverse the input linked lists `l1` and `l2`.
   - `result` is a dummy node to help build the resulting linked list.
   - `current` is used to add new nodes to the result list.

2. Traverse Both Lists:
   - While both lists have nodes, we:
     - Sum the values of the current nodes along with any carry from the previous step.
     - Update `carry` using integer division (`carry = sum / 10`).
     - Create a new node with the single-digit result (`sum % 10`) and link it to the result list. This is the unit digit of the sum.
     - Move `first`, `second`, and `current` to their next nodes.

3. Handle Remaining Nodes in the Longer List:
   - If one list is longer than the other, we continue the addition with the remaining nodes and the carry.
   - Check which list in not null and enter that loop
   - We use similar logic: add the current node value with carry, create a new node for the result, and move pointers forward.

4. Handle Final Carry:
   - After finishing both lists, if thereâ€™s still a carry left (like adding 9 + 1), we just create a final node with that carry.

5. Return the Result List:
   - Since the first node was a placeholder node, we return `result.next` to get the actual head of the resulting list.
